# 💰 Search your cryptocurrency card

Search your cryptocurrency card is a Flutter-based mobile application that users can request real-time information on various cryptocurrencies. Users can search for a specific cryptocurrency, and the app will display relevant data in a card format. The card includes essential information such as the cryptocurrency's name, price in USD, last updated price, symbol, and a brief description.

## 🏋🏻 Getting Started

- `TOKEN_API` is the API endpoint (in this case coinmarketcap is used)

TOKEN_API_KEY = ......
```
